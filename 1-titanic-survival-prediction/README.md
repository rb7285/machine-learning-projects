## 🧪 Workflow:
1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Handle missing values (Age, Embarked, Cabin)
3. Feature engineering (Title extraction, family size, encoding categorical variables)
4. Data visualization and correlation analysis
5. Train multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN
6. Evaluate models using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
